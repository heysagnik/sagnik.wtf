Hey there! I'm Sagnik ([@heysagnik](https://github.com/heysagnik)), and if you're reading this, you probably vibe with open source—or you're at least curious about it. Either way, welcome to my little corner of the internet.

## Why Open Source?

Let's be real: open source is kinda like the group project where everyone actually *wants* to contribute. No gatekeeping, no "you can't sit with us" energy. Just people building cool stuff together, learning from each other, and making tech better for everyone.

## My Journey

I started out lurking on GitHub, star-ing random repos and thinking, "Whoa, these people are geniuses." Fast forward a bit, and I realized: you don't have to be a 10x dev to contribute. Sometimes it's fixing a typo, sometimes it's squashing a bug, sometimes it's just opening an issue and starting a convo.

## The Vibes

- **Community > Competition**: It's not about flexing, it's about helping.
- **Learning by Doing**: Tutorials are cool, but PRs hit different.
- **Imposter Syndrome? Relatable.**: But trust me, everyone starts somewhere.

## How to Start

1. Find a project you vibe with (shameless plug: check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/heysagnik)).
2. Read the README (seriously, it helps).
3. Ask questions. People are nicer than you think.
4. Make your first PR—even if it's tiny.

## Final Thoughts

Open source isn't just about code. It's about people, ideas, and making the internet a little bit cooler. So if you're on the fence, just jump in. You got this.

Stay curious,
Sagnik ✨
